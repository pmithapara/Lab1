	<p>Hello everyone, my name is Priyank Mithpara and this is not my first website!</p>
	<p>I'm a transfer student and this is my first semseter as an ITM major; thrid year in college. As a freshmen in college, I went to Harper college and later on I went to Loyola university. I was a pre-med student before I changed my major to ITM. Computers and coding alway fasinated me; moreover, I alway wanted to build app for industrial and business use. It's better late than never. During last semester, I decided that I don't want to be a pre-med student and what to be someone who is doing hands on coding and changing the future of upcoming technology.</p>
